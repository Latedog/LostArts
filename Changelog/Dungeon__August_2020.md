- Fixed bug that would require an ActivePoisonBomb to be walked over twice to be activated
- Added new custom action functions to the Dungeon class that provide support for multiple actions and spawn actions
- trapEncounter, monsterTrapEncounter and singleMonsterTrapEncounter now check for ALL traps with a matching (x, y) pair
