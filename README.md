# Lost Arts

### About the repo:

This project is only guaranteed to be compatible with Cocos2d-x API version 3.17 (documentation [here](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/v3x/index.html)).
The numerous source files from the Cocos2d-x API required to get this project running are not provided here.
All fonts, art, and sound effects were taken from free, public sources on the internet to act as placeholders.

This was a solo project for fun/learning and currently development has been stopped, with no explicit plans on returning. Significant challenges that needed to be overcome include dynamic lighting on sprites (which required further expertise on shaders) and a system for easier level generation such as with a drag and drop GUI.


### About this game:
A tile-based, real-time rogue-like dungeon crawler with heavy RPG elements and dynamic interactions.

You're an adventurer that finds themselves at the entrance to the mysterious ruins of Arcana (name WIP), an ancient place where the art of creating magic has been lost to time. Armed with your trusty sword and shield, you must fight monsters, avoid deadly traps, collect items, and make your way to the source of where it all started! Only the strongest, or most clever, can hope to unlock the secrets that lie within the ruins. But be cautious, you don't know what's hiding in the dark... will you be able to make it out--alive?
